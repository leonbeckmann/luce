/**
 * Representing the Healthcare Test from Section 5.2.2:
 *
 * "The patient Alice is treated in the hospital. For this she
 * allows the nurses and the doctors to read restricted parts
 * of her patient record. Further, the doctors are allowed to
 * append Aliceâ€™s record. For emergencies, Alice names Bob as
 * her legal representative. Due to a complication during
 * surgery, the doctor requires read access to the complete
 * patient record, to check past diseases. Since Alice is
 * under anesthesia, Bob as her legal representative has to
 * allow the doctors to read the complete record for 24 hours,
 * on condition that the local copy is deleted again after no
 * later than 24 hours. All participants trust the state health
 * management facility."
 *
 * From Section 4.1.:
 * Records are created by the patient itself. Records and
 * policies are stored centrally at the health management
 * facility, which sends policies together with the records
 * on request.
